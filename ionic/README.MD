# D3.js with Ionic 2 Examples

We'll implement a few D3.js examples described in [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/) in Angular2.

##  Examples Summary

```bash
	npm install d3 --save
	npm install @types/d3 --save-dev --save-exact

		```bash
    		ionic add platform android 
    		ionic add platform ios
    		ionic run android
    		ionic run ios 
    		(don't work under ionic 2.0)
